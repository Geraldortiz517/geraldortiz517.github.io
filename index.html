      <p>  Since the first moment we started talking i felt a unique connection, i have enjoy every single second
        we've spend together, you are definitly the prittiest thing i've ever seen 
        but more than that you are an amazing soul, a kind heart, an amazing mind, a selfless person, an amazing road trip budy
      is not sorprice i'm falling for you, you are everything i ever dream of and a lot more, i'm so gratefull 
      to have met such a smart, kind, lovely and gorgeus girl.</p>

      <p>Not so long ago life was teaching me lessons the hard way, little did i know that 
        god was bringing such blessings in to my life, litte did i know that god was listenig when i
       prayed for someone like you.</p>
      <p> And also, wanted to thank you for all the things you've done for me, speccially for being there
        in my sad moments, for being that person i can't wait to talk with at the end of the day, for 
        taking the time to meet me, for sharing every day with me.</p>

      <blockquote>Don't fight it, use what happens.</blockquote>
      <p>If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. This is your world. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.</p>
      <p>Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Let's do that again. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>
